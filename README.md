### Features
- hardware id login
- update checker
- auto cheat update at launch

> It was meant to be a paid cheat. Users had to send their hwid to me and I will manually add it into a file hosted on github. As I stopped playing games, the project was deprecated. Things I wanted to do: dedicated site for payments that will automaticaly add the hwid into a database, cleaner code. The source code for the latest version of the cheat is lost, only the old ones are available.
